# Azure DevOps Build & Release YAML Templates  

### We're happy to have you! ðŸ˜Š
Contributing is easy. If creating an issue, please refer to the template below in the **Issue** section. Please refer to Flutter best practices detailed in the **Development** section.

## Contributor Types

Please note there are three types of contributers:
- **EventHopper Friends** - _Contribute as you have time!_
- **EventHopper Joey** - _Looking to join team, must follow [point system requirements](https://github.com/EventHopper/EHFlutter/blob/beta/CONTRIBUTING.md#point-system)_
- **EventHopper Core** - _follow EventHopper team role requirements_

## Issues

We try our best to keep a logical formatting on our issues. The three most important _**Information Points**_ to include are a **Description** _(thorough description of the issue)_, **Starting Requirements** _(any issues or features that need to be resolved before work can start on this issue - apply own judgement but ask around too)_, **Completion Requirements** _(every task that needs to be completed by one or more PRs in order to close the issue)_

```java

for(int i = 0; i<10; i++) {
  print('hi there!');
}

```
